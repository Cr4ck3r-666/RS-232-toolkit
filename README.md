# RS-232-toolkit

# Introduction's 
RS 232 toolkit is a console aplication for communication on RS232 port
at linux system. That's tool was created for fun and bether experience
of C++ leanguige. My first plan for usage that's aplication for a hacking
decoders and bether experience of port funcionality in linux. And in this 
moment I don't have a time on this project ,becouse I have many other project's
in realization and will fount an other tool for hacking decoder's. So I said 
that will make that project in public repository and give that's repository 
in hand's of comunity.So let's treat it as a social and programming experiment.
So just for fun haha
